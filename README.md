Make it functional to redirect the user to the desired location based upon the selected link and personalize it.

### Useful resources

- [HTML/ CSS Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) - This helped me for validating my HTML/ CSS code and improve it for better accesibility and semantics. I really liked this tool and will use it going forward.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand concepts of Grid/ Flexbox better.
